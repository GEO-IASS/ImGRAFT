* Alternative matching algorithms. 
* Polish PC matching...
* Figure out licensing and include example data.
* improve readme. 



TODO:
* implement a simple stereo photogrammetry example.
	* Input: two images with known internal camera parameters, and some GCPs in one of them (if sufficient GCPs then we can also determine internal camera params). 
    * Use template match to find common features between images
	* Use LMFsolve on a the matched set pixel coordinates to find external camera parameters and XYZ coords.
	
* example using opticalflow algos. 

* sat example (landsat?).
